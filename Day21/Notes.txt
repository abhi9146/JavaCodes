The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that aim to create more maintainable, scalable, and flexible software. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are an acronym for the following five principles: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
